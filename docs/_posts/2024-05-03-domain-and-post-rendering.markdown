Hey dear members! Here I am with the news!

Yesterday, **I carefully applied the `mmodding.com` domain to our website** (that we did't own before sadly, yeah) meaning that we have now beautiful links for our socials!
- [mmodding.com/youtube](https://mmodding.com/youtube) redirects to our YouTube channel
- [mmodding.com/discord](https://mmodding.com/discord) redirects to our Discord server
- [mmodding.com/x](https://mmodding.com/x) redirects to our X/Twitter profile
- [mmodding.com/github](https://mmodding.com/github) redirects to our GitHub organization

I may also add Modrinth and Curseforge link? Not sure about that. If I do it it should probably be separated from the other ones in the navbar at least.

Second thing: **I now updated the posts render!** It's not perfect yet, it will probably have other improvements in the future, but currently it is sufficent for us.
- The markdown now renders better than before.
- Some work on the codeblock css to prepare a color highlighting syntax for the future docs.

Future goals:
- Add an about page.
- Create the docs base, a base that would be enough for people to start contributing to it!
