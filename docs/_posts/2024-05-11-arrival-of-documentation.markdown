Here I am again, dear members!

Today, lot of news, from small ones to bigger ones!

Firstly: some rendering issues were noticed on the website on small~medium screens, notably on the home page with the posts display. It's now fixed, meaning that the description will not be *in* the bottom label anymore. The next step will be to ensure a good rendering of the website on very small display (like phones), because currently it do not look very good on those platforms.

Secondly: the Discord Server is receiving new improvements! It includes the arrival of optional roles that you can pick in the "Channels and Roles" builtin Discord channel, which is present at the top of the server. So, there are the new roles:

- `@Mod Updates` => this one will be used to notify people about new versions released on Modrinth/CurseForge/GitHub
- `@Blog Updates` => this one is for posts! Yeah, it includes the thing you are currently reading, and at the time when you are reading that post, the `MonitoRSS` bot should have sent a message in the [#blog](https://discord.com/channels/1142972540810178720/1234595183774138390) channel, mentioning that new role
- `@Development Updates` => this one is... for development updates x), when we will post development new about our projects in the [#mod-development](https://discord.com/channels/1142972540810178720/1142975463829024868) channel, we will mostly use this new role from now

And Finally: the Documentation is moving (more coming than moving since the old one was pretty weird) from https://mmodding.gitbook.io to this website! You can now see a new dropdown menu in the navigation bar, named `Documentation` that will show you the different avalaible documentations you can look on. Currently there is only one for the `MModding Library`, version `0.0.1-alpha` (released for 1.18.2), version `0.0.2-alpha` (the one currently highly developped for 1.19.2), and version `0.1.0-beta` (the targeted version by the [MModding Experiments](https://github.com/MModding/mmodding-experiments) repository, that will cover a future version of the library for 1.19.4). Current documentation is really not full yet and need a lot of work to be finished for version `0.0.2-alpha` (we will not work anymore on `0.1.0-alpha`, which is discontinued).

And that is pretty much all I wanted to say for today. Thank you for reading that post! Hope our community will continue to grow, and that our current projects will be released in a near future.

Goodbye you all!
