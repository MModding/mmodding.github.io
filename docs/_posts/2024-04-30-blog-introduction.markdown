Hey y'all our dear users! This the first post of this new blog!

*A new blog? Why? You already have a [Discord]({{ site.url }}/discord)!*, you could say: and you're totally right!

The reason behind it is that I wanted to give to the MModding Organization a proper website (at least better than the old one) and to add it a blog in order to write better information for our users.

Discord isn't bad at all, otherwise we wouldn't have a dedicated server to our team content in it, but it still has some limitations:
- We can't write very long messages. Pretty annoying when we want to write big messages.
- We can controll the website user-interface, contrary to Discord's one.
- We can classify our posts with tags, allowing you to understand what are the main ideas of them.
- We can use attachments in a better way, spreading them into the post instead of just having all of them at the bottom of the message.

As you can see, the post display is still a bit weird, but we will enhance it in order to have a better website look in the future.

If you have issues, enchancements or that you find bugs (that don't seems too obvious to not have been already found by me) you can use the [Website Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MModding/mmodding.github.io/issues)!

Post Scriptum: there's now a second thing that I can add in my "if-you-ask-for-it-I-will-break-your-legs" list, a light mode for the website.
