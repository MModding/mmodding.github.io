Hey everyone! How are you all?

A big update has been made to the MModding Organization lastly: the Silent Winds team, behind the Archeon mod (which I am the lead developer), is now the same entity as the MModding!

All rights are now under the MModding Organization to make the management of our projects easier, as we had mostly the same team members, only the leaders differed.

But the Silent Winds did not disappear, its name has been changed to "Silent Winds Universe", and designates a "lore universe" for some of our projects.

So, except rights, what does it change?

There are now three leaders at the top of the MModding Organization:
* Aeramisu, an artist and composer of MModding
* Aethyus, an artist and builder of MModding
* The Administrative Owner/KeyHolder, Mega (me), the main developer of MModding

To add other changes, we also modified few things on our Discord Server:
* More channels to cover more subjects, not only MModding/Minecraft/Programming related content and topics
* A "Frequently Asked Questions" channels covering questions about Minecraft Versions, Platforms and Rights about our projects
* The `#mod-development` channel is also now used to show concept arts or art representations of future content of our projects

And that is, pretty much all for the changes, if I did not forget some.

To end this (small) blog post, I will say goodbye to you all! We have a lot of projects we are preparing, and we hope that we
will be able to show you content of them, and also push a beta of Archeon in a near future!
