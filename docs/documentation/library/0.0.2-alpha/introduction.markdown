## **Start with the MModding Library Base Content**

The MModding Library Base Content contains some classes that allows you to improve the management of your mod elements.

We will begin our example mod with the creation of its main class followed by the use of the `ElementInitializer` interface.

<a class="button" href="{{ page.url }}/create-the-main-class">Create the Main Class of the Mod</a>
<a class="button" href="{{ page.url }}/manage-elements-with-elements-initializers">Manage Elements with Element Initializers</a>

Your mod should have other Main Classes for Client Side Content or Dedicated Server Side Content. No worries, the MModding Library has differents supports for these sides!
